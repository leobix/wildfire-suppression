slopover south of primary containment lines in the kirby peak area  where challenging terrain and heavy fuels may necessitate the use of indirect attack and firing operations in some locations. this slopover resulted in evacuation orders for approximately 5 000 residents. see box 30 for specifics.   there is a public meeting scheduled in groveland on friday.   this area has a history of producing very rapid rates of spread when fire comes into alignment with wind and topography under northwestern wind flow. in 1961 the harlow fire burned 20 000 acres in 2 hours in this area. southeastern fire spread has moved the ferguson fire into similar fuels and topography in this area. until the cedar fire in 2003  the harlow fire held the record for the most acres burned in a single shift.  the incident base for the ferguson fire is at the ahwahnee hills regional park. additional camps have been established at badger pass and drew meadows.  operations are being conducted under a joint delegation of authority from the sierra national forest  yosemite national park and the stanislaus national forest.,2018-07-26 08:00:00,7/26/2018 19:00,,,Y,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,Short Grass (1

temperatures and low humidities.  the ferguson fire is burning in very difficult terrain with limited access. hazards to firefighters include large areas of tree mortality  above average temperatures and rolling rocks. critically dry  decadent brush  fully cured grass and low thousand hour fuel moistures are contributing to fire behavior. the potential for significant fire growth is possible with increases of wind; when wind and slope come into alignment; or if plume dominated fire occurs.  crews and dozers  supported by air resources  are working to isolate the slopover that occurred south of kirby peak  beyond primary containment lines. alternate and contingency lines are in place if direct suppression efforts are unsuccessful. if containment efforts are successful  firing will resume toward wawona as conditions allow. significant tree mortality is present where firing will occur  causing heightened safety and control concerns. this line will help keep fire from moving south into more densely populated areas. the community of wawona has structure defense in place.  on the stanislaus national forest  hand crews and dozers are constructing direct and indirect line around the fire connecting montgomery ridge  existing lines from the rim fire on pilot ridge  the old yosemite coulterville road  buena vista and eagle peak to el portal. the fire has reached the sparser fuels of the the 2011 motor fire scar  which has slowed spread to the east. this line may be fired as conditions necessitate.   the western edge of the ferguson fire south of the merced river is holding from the previous firing operation. crews are increasing the depth of mop up to further strengthen this line.  crews are firing the indirect line on henness ridge to protect el portal. the community of yosemite west is prepped and lined.  plans are in place to fire highway 41  with timing of the operation coordinated carefully with the firing operations on henness ridge and on the south side of the fire.  on the southeastern side of the fire  resources are coordinating with yosemite national park and have inserted wildland fire modules to tie in natural features  the empire fire scar and the south fork fire scar with indirect fire line.  continued contingency work on all sides of the fire will provide for other options in the event of unplanned fire spread.  structure defense is ongoing

structure protection specialists are in place in yosemite west  foresta  and wawona in the event of unplanned fire spread.     east of highway 41  wildland fire modules continue indirect handline to connect the 2017 empire burn scar to the south fork of the merced river.  north of the merced river  crews and dozers complete indirect line from soapstone ridge to montgomery gulch and on to pilot peak. wildland fire modules establish indirect line in the montgomery ridge area. resources take opportunities to engage the fire edge directly where fire behavior has moderated on soapstone ridge and grizzly flat area or anderson valley. firefighters continue with structure defense in the el portal area  and implement structure defense plans for the grizzly flat area.  crews  continue to patrol control lines around jerseydale and mariposa pines.  in the west  crews patrol control lines in the sweetwater ridge area to the merced river.  structure defense efforts will continue in affected communities. contingency line construction will continue around the fire area.  air resources work to limit fire spread as needed.,45380000.0,,,,,,,crews and dozers are currently constructing contingency line to contain the slopover south of primary containment lines in the kirby peak area  where challenging terrain and heavy fuels may necessitate the use of indirect attack and firing operations in some locations. this slopover resulted in evacuation orders for approximately 5 000 residents. see box 30 for specifics.   there is a public meeting scheduled in groveland on friday.   this area has a history of producing very rapid rates of spread when fire comes into alignment with wind and topography under northwestern wind flow. in 1961 the harlow fire burned 20 000 acres in 2 hours in this area. southeastern fire spread has moved the ferguson fire into similar fuels and topography in this area. until the cedar fire in 2003  the harlow fire held the record for the most acres burned in a single shift.  the incident base for the ferguson fire is at the ahwahnee hills regional park. additional camps have been established at badger pass and drew meadows.  operations are being conducted under a joint delegation of authority from the sierra national forest  yosemite national park and the stanislaus national forest.,2018-07-26 20:00:00,7/27/2018

communities of mariposa pines and jerseydale and west of henness ridge|a heat advisory remains in place in the fire area  with above normal high temperatures and low humidities.  the ferguson fire is burning in very difficult terrain with limited access. hazards to firefighters include large areas of tree mortality  above average temperatures and rolling rocks. critically dry  decadent brush  fully cured grass and low thousand hour fuel moistures are contributing to fire behavior. the potential for significant fire growth is possible with increases of wind; when wind and slope come into alignment; or if plume dominated fire occurs.  crews and dozers are working to isolate the slopover that occurred south of kirby peak  beyond primary containment lines. alternate and contingency lines are in place if direct suppression efforts are unsuccessful. if containment efforts are successful  firing will resume toward wawona as conditions allow. significant tree mortality is present where firing will occur  causing heightened safety and control concerns. this line will help keep fire from moving south into more densely populated areas. the community of wawona has structure defense in place.  on the stanislaus national forest  hand crews and dozers are constructing direct and indirect line around the fire connecting montgomery ridge  existing lines from the rim fire on pilot ridge  the old yosemite coulterville road  buena vista and eagle peak to el portal. the fire has reached the sparser fuels of the the 2011 motor fire scar  which has slowed spread to the east. this line may be fired as conditions necessitate.   the western edge of the ferguson fire south of the merced river is holding from the previous firing operation. crews are increasing the depth of mop up to further strengthen this line.  crews are firing the indirect line on henness ridge to protect el portal. the community of yosemite west is prepped and lined.  plans are in place to fire highway 41  with timing of the operation coordinated carefully with the firing operations on henness ridge and on the south side of the fire.  on the southeastern side of the fire  resources are coordinating with yosemite national park and have inserted wildland fire modules to tie in natural features  the empire fire scar and the south fork fire scar with indirect fire line.  continued contingency work on all sides of the fire will provide for other options in the event of unplanned fire spread.  structure defense is ongoing in threatened communities. evacuations will be lifted or implemented as needed.,1,0,0,1,0,0,5236.0,20.0,5181.0,FS,Full Supression,,,10.0,4312.0,828.5512821,0.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,Y,Y,,observed:  the inversion developed again overnight with smoky conditions and poor visibility. breezy evening winds gusting around 15 mph decreased to light and variable after midnight. temperatures dropped into the lower to mid-70s. relative humidity recovery was mostly 40-50 percent but only around 35 percent in the thermal belts.  forecasted:  reduced visibility in thick smoke will prevail through the morning with some improvement in the afternoon as the inversion struggles to lift. afternoon ridge winds from the west southwest will gust to around 17 mph. otherwise  typical slope and canyon winds will prevail. a heat advisory is still in effect with low elevation temperatures in
